It's funny how I find myself
In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose
One half won't do

I've asked myself how much do you
Commit yourself

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

I would tell myself what good you do
Convince myself

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends
It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends
