Thinking in square rooms
A human without illusions
Sad strains on a sad face
Is that what we've come to?

Is the world bold
This love old
Moving nowhere
And it's gonna cold
The wind stops
The clouds go
We're all alone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I know
I can see those
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I know
I can see those
I can feel those
I can see those

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen
They don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen
They don't care
If a man is in despair

Walks long and long clears
The vision of one with one
And you still move me
You undo me like you've always done
But I realize now
We've not made you out of words now
Just you and me
Just you and me until the end of time

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I know
I can see those
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I know
I can see those
I can feel those
I can see those

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen
They don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen
They don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
They don't listen
They don't care
If a man is in despair

Oh oh oh oh oh
Square rooms
