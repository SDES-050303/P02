Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore

We've got the right to choose and
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life
This is our song

We'll fight the powers that be, just
Don't pick our destiny, 'cause
You don't know us
You don't belong

Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore

Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want nothing
Not a thing from you

Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated
If that's your best
Your best won't do

Woah, oh
Woah, oh
We're right (yeah)
We're free (yeah)
We'll fight (yeah)
You'll see (yeah)

Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
No way

Woah, oh
Woah, oh
We're right (yeah)
We're free (yeah)
We'll fight (yeah)
You'll see (yeah)

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We're not gonna take it (no)
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)

Oh, we're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)
Oh, we're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform?)
We're not gonna take it anymore
