(Once upon a time, not so long ago)

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're halfway there
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Oh-oh, living on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're halfway there
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Living on a prayer

Ooh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Whoa, we're halfway there
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Oh-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Oh-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Oh-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand
